<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This fragrant, Italian-style preparation for plump, extra-large shrimp cooked in white wine, lemon juice, fresh parsley, scallions, and the most divinely buttery garlic sauce is the classic shrimp scampi dish enjoyed at restaurants everywhere.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4-5 large garlic cloves, minced (or 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds (600 grams) large shrimp prawns, shelled with tails on or off</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes or to taste (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pan or skillet. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds - 1 minute). Then add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1-2 minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip. 
        </li>
        <li>Pour in wine (or broth), add red pepper flakes (if using). Bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the shrimp is cooked through (don't over cook your shrimp).</li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining butter, lemon juice and parsley and take off heat immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, pasta, garlic bread or steamed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini noodles).</li>
    </ol>
